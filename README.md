# A Simple Weather-Chatbot using Python
### In this project, I implemented a simple chatbot with the main topic of conversation being to ask about today's weather, using Python language.
## Introduction
### This chatbot is set up to perform the following functions:
- Greet the user and ask their name
- Respond to basic questions about the weather (predefined responses).
- Recognize when the user wants to end the conversation.
